There are several things I would like you to do

1: impliment the remember me functionality. It should be implimented in the controller.js file under the folder controllers
2: Allow login using email. This should be implimented in the user.js under the models folder
3: Search for a user with the username that was provided OR the email that was provided in controllers.js
4: Add ejs in login.ejs and signup.ejs to show the errorMessage provided by controller.js
5: edit the UI of signup.ejs to match the UI in "Finished Signup.ejs.png" under the Example Finished
